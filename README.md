# NexTrade: A Decentralized Indian Stock Trading Application

## Introduction

NexTrade is a decentralized stock trading application built on blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof platform for trading stocks. This application leverages Ethereum smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer stock trading without the need for intermediaries.

NexTrade offers a foundational framework for a decentralized trading platform, showcasing how blockchain can be applied to financial markets in India. It provides a basic implementation that can be expanded into a fully functional decentralized application (DApp) with additional features.

## Features

- **Decentralized Trading**: Trade stocks directly with one another without a centralized authority.
- **Smart Contracts**: Ensure security, transparency, and immutability using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Stock Ownership Tracking**: Ownership is recorded on the blockchain, making all trades final and verifiable.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible from any device, allowing users to trade stocks on the go.

## Technology Stack

NexTrade is built using the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: The smart contract language used to implement the core trading logic on Ethereum.
- **Ethereum**: The decentralized platform that hosts the NexTrade smart contract.
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for the backend server.
- **Web3.py**: A Python library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend of the application for a simple and usable interface.

### Explanation of Key Directories and Files

- **contracts/NexTrade.sol**: Solidity smart contract that defines core trading logic and handles stock transactions.
- **app/**: Flask backend code, including configuration, routes, and models.
- **migrations/**: Placeholder for database migrations.
- **static/css/**: Contains CSS files used to style the frontend.
- **templates/index.html**: Main HTML file serving as the frontend of the application.
- **.env**: Environment variables, e.g., Flask secret key.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies required to run the Flask application.
- **run.py**: Entry point for the Flask application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: Required to run the Flask backend.
- **Node.js and npm**: Used to install Ethereum development tools.
- **Ganache**: Personal Ethereum blockchain for development.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with DApps.



## Usage

### Adding a Stock:
1. Open the NexTrade application in your browser.
2. Enter the name and price of the stock in the "Add Stock" form.
3. Click "Add Stock" to submit the form.
4. The stock is added to the blockchain, and you become the owner.

### Buying a Stock:
1. Enter the name of the stock in the "Buy Stock" form.
2. Click "Buy Stock" to submit the form.
3. If the stock exists and you have sufficient funds, the transaction is executed, and ownership is transferred to you.

## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication**: Implement a secure system for user accounts and logins.
- **Real-Time Stock Prices**: Integrate with an external API for real-time prices.
- **Advanced Trading Features**: Add limit orders, stop-loss orders, and trading history.
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Improve frontend design for better mobile accessibility.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Allow users to vote on platform changes using a decentralized voting mechanism.
