# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As contributors and maintainers of the NexTrade project, we are committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. We value the participation of each member of our community and want to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants' behavior and the steps to report unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards

We expect all participants in our community to:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with respect, regardless of their background, abilities, or opinions. Disagreements are natural but should be handled constructively.
  
- **Be Considerate**: Remember that your actions and words can affect others. Be thoughtful in your communication and consider the impact on others before making decisions.
  
- **Be Collaborative**: Open-source projects thrive on collaboration. Share knowledge, help others, and be open to receiving feedback.
  
- **Show Empathy**: Be empathetic to the perspectives and experiences of others. Aim to understand and support your fellow community members.
  
- **Promote Diversity and Inclusion**: Encourage diverse perspectives and contributions. Ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued in the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, including but not limited to verbal or written comments, jokes, or images that are discriminatory or derogatory.
  
- **Discrimination**: Exclusionary behavior based on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, religion, or other personal attributes.
  
- **Violence or Threats**: Threats of violence or promotion of violence towards others.
  
- **Intimidation or Stalking**: Any form of intimidation, stalking, or following that makes others feel unsafe.
  
- **Inappropriate Language or Imagery**: The use of inappropriate, offensive, or sexually explicit language or imagery in any community space.

## Reporting Issues

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. You can report issues by:

- Contacting the project maintainers directly via email.
- Filing a confidential issue in the repository.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly. We will take appropriate action to address the situation, which may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the community.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other project maintainers.
